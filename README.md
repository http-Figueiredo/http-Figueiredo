- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT (the basic of front-end, right?) and trying to learn java and python... And I have plans to learn C#, SQL and PHP.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a FUll-STACK JOB, I don't really have a dream job like work at google or apple, you know... But I'll work hard and keep evolving at any place that look for me.
